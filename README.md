# Customer Satisfaction Analysis – Power BI Project

This project analyzes customer satisfaction and feedback using a simulated dataset collected via Microsoft Forms. It demonstrates how Power BI can be used to identify service gaps, analyze response time, and turn raw feedback into actionable insights.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze satisfaction levels based on response time and service experience.
- Visualize customer feedback trends and suggestions.
- Identify potential trust or loyalty gaps.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for service improvement.

## 📊 Tools Used

- Microsoft Forms (survey)
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning)
- Microsoft Power BI (dashboard + visual storytelling)
- PowerPoint (presentation design)

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Faster response time leads to higher satisfaction and willingness to reuse the service.
- Only 50% of users would reuse the service despite high satisfaction ratings indicating a trust/loyalty gap.
- Most suggestions were related to speed and communication clarity.
- Peak failures often occurred on specific days or times, revealing operational inefficiencies.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Improve service responsiveness and set clear expectations with users.
- Automate follow ups and create transparency in service timelines.
- Use dashboards to monitor and respond to feedback trends.

## 📎 Files

- `Customer_Satisfaction_Presentation.pptx` – final presentation slides
- `Customer_Satisfaction_Report.pbix` – Power BI report file
- `Customer_Feedback_Data.xlsx` – Excel survey responses file

## 🚧 Future Improvements (Planned Updates)

This is the first version of the project. I plan to enhance it further by:

- Automating the data collection and notification process using **n8n**.
- Adding **drillthrough** and **tooltip** pages in Power BI.
- Enhancing visual storytelling and layout clarity.
- Simulating real-world business scenarios more deeply.

Next version will represent a fully automated, smart feedback analysis system.
